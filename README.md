# My React App

A demo repository for setting up a React project without Create React App. This repository is used in my article [Set up a React project without Create React App](https://pkim.me/set-up-a-react-project-without-create-react-app/).

To get started, install the packages:

```
nvm use && npm install
```

To run a development server with hot module replacement, run the following:

```
npm run start
```

To build production-ready assets, run the following:

```
npm run build
```
